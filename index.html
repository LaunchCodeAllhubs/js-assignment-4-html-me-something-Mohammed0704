            <h2>Philly, USA</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Philadelphia, PA and have lived here all of my life.
               My mother migrated here from Egypt. I love the city and I am a big fan of the sports teams.

            <h2>Rome, Italy</h2>
            <p>My dad lives in Rome, Italy so I went to go visit him one summer. I believe it was almost
               10 years ago so I don't remember much. However, there are of course places that I could
               never forget visiting like the Colosseum and Trevi Fountain.

            <h2>Cairo, Egypt</h2>
            <p>I went to Egypt to visit my family. I have a lot of family there and have been there times so I was able to visit
               a lot of places. My most recent visit way in 2021. I went to the pyramids, the Egyptian museum, and the Nile River.

         <!-- Talk about time in Pakistan-->
         <h2>Abbottabad, Pakistan</h2>
         <p>I have only been to Pakistan once and it was for my sister's weeding in 2017. I did enjoy my time there
            and one difference I can tell when visiting Pakistan is that there are a lot of moutains.
